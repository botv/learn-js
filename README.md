## Introduction
### Why extensions?
Coding is a lot more enjoyable when you see the effects your projects can have on people's lives. Chrome extensions, unlike websites, mobile apps, or desktop apps, can be created and released within a matter of minutes. With simple, rigid architecture, extensions don't allow much room for error, which builds strong habits and internalizes good conventions. JavaScript, the main language used in Chrome Extensions, also happens to have the biggest developer community of any language out there.

### Where to start
I recommend following the first tutorial listed in the [tutorials section](#tutorials) below, and then, depending on how comfortable that felt, either move to an intermediate tutorial or continue with the next basic tutorial. Once you feel comfortable with developing Chrome extensions at an intermediate level, come up with a simple idea for an extension. My first extension replaced all B's on a page with "üÖ±Ô∏è" (https://github.com/botv/hey-beter). Don't try to build a utility, think of pranks and jokes that would be amusing to people on the internet. Not surprisingly, one of the biggest markets for Chrome extensions is memers and dumb teens on the internet.
